🔍 Key Highlights:

Utilized a dataset from Kaggle.com to build the model.
Applied data science techniques such as data cleaning, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, outlier detection, and one-hot encoding to preprocess the dataset.
Built a machine learning model using scikit-learn and exported it as a pickle file for deployment.

💡 Deployment & Backend Integration:

Developed a backend server using Python Flask to consume the trained model and provide price predictions.
Exposed HTTP endpoints for GET and POST requests to interact with the model.
Created a user-friendly UI using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make requests and display results dynamically.

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used:

Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas for data cleaning, Matplotlib for data visualization, and scikit-learn for model building
Backend: Flask
Frontend: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
